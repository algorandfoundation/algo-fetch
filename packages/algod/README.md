# Overview

This release includes networking optimization improvements, as well as starts laying the groundwork for non-archival relays.

**Note: in this release, NetAddress will no longer automatically mark a node as archival, so if you were relying solely on NetAddress for this, you should also set `Archival: true` in your configuration before applying the upgrade.** This is a rare configuration, but if you only had NetAddress set, this release will progressively delete blocks from your database until the node only has recent blocks (probably over multiple days while staying caught up to the chain). The sqlite database will not reclaim this disk automatically, so you may want to run a vacuum after it's complete by shutting down the node and running: `sqlite3 data/mainnet-v1.0/ledger.block.sqlite "VACUUM"`

If you intend to become non-archival (formerly as an archival node), your best path forward is a fresh install.
